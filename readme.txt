This project started as a final project for 6.811/PPAT, an MIT class on Assistive Technologies.

Welcome to SmartClicker!

Smart Clicker is a virtual mouse software for people with alternative computer inputs, such as Head Tracking Mouse hardware.

Unfortunately, it is Windows specific.

Similar software out there includes:

Point N Click: http://www.polital.com/pnc/

Dwell Clicker 2: http://www.sensorysoftware.com/dwellclicker.html

We hope you like it!

Once the software reaches a more polished state, this readme will likely expand to explain features. Until then, we apologize.
